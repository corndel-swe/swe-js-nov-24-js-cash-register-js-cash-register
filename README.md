# cash-register

It's a repo where we refactor the cash-register project to add more, smaller jumps in difficulty so apprentices can reach milestones and feel encouraged. This is underpinned by the T&L principles of scaffolding, differentiation and chunking.

Another feature we believe could be tweaked is the data structures, as they are somewhat un-natural and therefore difficult to work with. It is understandable that we want the apprentices to work with 2D arrays but it feels slightly contrived in this instance and we feel an array of objects is a more intuitive structure.
